### Hi there!

Hi, I'm Nick. I'm a computer science student in the last stretches of getting a Bachelor's degree. I'm still figuring out what I like the most and in the process I'm trying out and learning a lot of new stuff. From web dev, DevOps or AI to IoT, I'm really open to new stuff and want to learn as much as possible on the way.
